# Stereo_Matching
The goal of this task is to implement and compare different methods for calculating disparity maps from stereo images.<br/>
The implemented algorithms are:

* Naive Approach
* Dynamic Programming Approach
* OpenCV's StereoBM

The algorithms can be run using the following command:
```
./OpenCV_naive_stereo Image1 Image2 output window_size occlusion_weight
```
The other python files can be run independently using Visual Studio or any other IDE.
